<h2>What is Anthroposophy?</h2>
<blockquote>&quot;Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge aiming to guide the spiritual element in the human being to the spiritual in the universe.  &quot;<br /><cite title="Source Title"> --  Rudolf Steiner  </cite></blockquote>

 <img width="200"  src="pages/imgs/portrait.jpg" class="img-left" alt=""><p>Rudolf Steiner was born on February 27, 1861 in what is now Croatia and died on March 30, 1925 in Dornach, Switzerland. From his early beginnings as a philosopher, scientist and Goethe scholar Rudolf Steiner developed Anthroposophy, a far reaching and monumental project to re direct our increasingly materialistic culture along spiritual lines.</p>
<p>His insights were based on his ability to perceive the spiritual forces underpinning the physical and psychical worlds and this lead to profound contributions in a wide variety of fields. His legacy has entered into the spiritual heritage of our time and continues to have a profound effect on many movements and individuals today.</p>
<p>Over 10,000 institutions and initiatives have been founded that in some way work out of anthroposophy: schools (often called Waldorf schools), curative education schools (Camphill and others) social initiatives, clinics, doctor&rsquo;s practices, pharmaceutical companies, biodynamic farms, banks, art schools, stage groups, businesses, etc.</p>
<p>At the heart of anthroposophy is a path of inner schooling that takes its starting point from modern, critical, subject/object orientated consciousness, and from there leads to a gradual awakening of 'imaginative', 'intuitive' and 'inspirational' form of consciousness.</p>
<p>Steiner's is a profoundly holistic and human centered world view that addresses many of the deep social and personal problems that we face today.</p>

<p><strong>The Medical Section </strong></p>
 <img width="300"  src="pages/imgs/goetheanuml.jpg" class="img-right" alt=""><p>In 1923/24, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society with the School of Spiritual Science at its core. It was to be... &quot;an association of people whose will it is to nurture the life of the soul, both in the individual and in human society, on the basis of a true knowledge of the spiritual world.&quot;</p>
<p>The Anthroposophical Society is public, without political agenda or religious affiliation. Its activity is seen today in independent national societies and initiatives throughout the world, with members from all cultures and continents. It is also an entirely public society, without regard to ethnic or national origin, social standing, religion, scientific or artistic conviction.</p>
<p> Within the Society, The School of Spiritual Science was set up to facilitate a spiritual approach to the different disciplines. This includes natural science, sociology, the arts, education, agriculture, mathematics and medicine.</p>
<p>The Medical Section devotes itself to medical and pharmaceutical research as well as to training and continuing education of physicians, pharmacists and therapists. It supports diverse therapeutic initiatives that have at their core a spiritual understanding of health and pathology. It also supports plurality in scientific discourse, the patient&rsquo;s right to choose and the legal battle for complementary medicine. In its collaborative work with the artistic and scientific sections two core questions of anthroposophical medicine are central: How does health arise? What is the nature of disease and healing?</p>
