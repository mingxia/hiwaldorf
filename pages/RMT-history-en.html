<h2>The History of the Rhythmical Massage Association</h2>

<p>The Rhythmical Massage Association had its beginnings in 1983 when Adrian Large brought together most of those who were actively working with Rhythmical Massage. Until then, there had never been more than 5 people working independently, in the UK practicing massage out of the Anthroposophical/Therapeutic approach.</p>

<p>Following on from this, came the formation of a professional organization called “The Association of Rhythmical Masseurs”.</p>

<p>The main aims were:</p>

<ul>
<li> To encourage the development of the Rhythmical Massage Profession in the UK.</li>

<li> To further professional skills and knowledge.</li>

<li> To become a group of supportive colleagues who in turn could help and encourage those who wanted to take a training in massage.</li>

<li> To maintain contact with others who were taking initiatives and responsibility for Rhythmical Massage in other countries.</li>

<li> To take up any legislative issues which might affect the right to practice Rhythmical Massage in other countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most important issues at that time was training. What kind of training should form the basis for the practice of Rhythmical Massage and what preparation would be necessary for those wishing to take up the formal training in Boll, Germany?</p>

----------------

<p>Some years later, on the 3rd June 2000, a group gathered together in Ilkley, Yorkshire, and a new Association, The Rhythmical Massage Therapy Association of the U.K. and Eire, was founded. It was attended by eleven people, all Rhythmical Massage Therapists. A council was set up and a chairman, secretary and treasurer were nominated.</p>

<h2>The Memorandum:</h2>

<p>The Association has as its objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li> To foster the development of the rhythmical massage therapy profession in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</li>

<li> To advance the awareness of colleagues, the wider medical profession, and public in the field of rhythmical massage therapy.</li>

<li> To conduct research into the above and to disseminate the results widely.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, in this constitution, “Rhythmical Massage Therapy” is a form of therapeutic massage arising from the insights of the Anthroposophy as outlined by Rudolf Steiner and developed by Dr Ita Wegman and Dr Margaretha Hauschka. This physical therapy addresses the needs of the patient in the realms of body, soul and spirit. As such, it is a therapeutic technique within the wider field of Anthroposophical medical therapy.</p>

<p>It states in The Articles of Association that members are expected to:</p>

<ul>
<li> Uphold the image of the human being as contained in Rudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophy.</li>

<li> Work in mutual co-operation with the Medical Section of the School for Spiritual Science, both in the U.K. and at the Goetheanum.

</li><li> Foster relationships and affiliation with other groups with similar interests, both in the U.K. and worldwide.</li>

<li> Promote mutual support and colleagueship between members, and further the development of rhythmical massage therapy by:</li>

a) Supporting and initiating training and research.

<br> b) Arranging conferences, workshops, newsletters and other appropriate means of communication.

<br> c) Maintaining a list of members.

<br> d) Making available to the public an up to date list of practising members.

<br>
<li> Becoming informed of relevant developments in legislation and provision for members comprising the Association and to advise them of such matters.</li>

<li> Promote high standards of professional conduct in terms of therapeutic practice, patient care and confidentiality. The Association will do this by promoting the following code of conduct for its members.</li> 
</ul>


<p>The Association will expect that members:</p>

<ul>
<li> Seek assistance, or refer the patient to his/her doctor, in any situation where the member may feel that he/she lacks the necessary knowledge or competence.</li>

<li> Refrain from making statements or claims misrepresenting the therapeutic benefits of treatment.</li>

<li> Maintain treatment rooms and ancillary areas in a clean and safe condition.</li>
