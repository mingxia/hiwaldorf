<h2>What is rhythmical massage therapy?</h2>
<img width="200" src="pages/imgs/image003.jpg" class="img-left" alt=""><p>What is rhythmical massage therapy and how is it different from classical forms of
  
  massage? What role does the anthroposophic background play in the therapeutic method
  
  developed by Ita Wegman MD and decisively influenced also by Margarethe Hauschka
  
  MD?</p>
<p>Stefan Härter describes the anthroposophic views of the human being that underlie this
  
  approach: touch and the twelve senses, rhythm and the four members or bodily sheaths,
  
  the threefold structure and function of the human organism. He also characterizes very
  
  specific massage movements and movement qualities, and the perspectives informing
  
  their use by therapists. Citing authentic case examples, he offers accessible and vivid
  
  insight into the practice of this holistic form of therapy.</p>
<p>Stefan Härter was born in eastern Switzerland in 1957. After attending business school in
  
  St. Gallen he trained as a nurse (AKP) in Winterthur. For many years he worked in social
  
  therapy, hydrotherapy, massage and as a care-home manager at Humanus Haus in
  
  Beitenwil near Bern. This was followed by work at the Ita Wegman Klinik in Arlesheim
  
  and Bern University psychiatric services. Subsequently he undertook further training in
  
  rhythmical massage therapy, manual lymph drainage and as adult educator. Since 1997
  
  he has been working as a therapist at the centre for medical and artistic therapy in Bern,
  
  and at Olaf Åsteson Haus social therapy community in Hinterfultigen. He is a co-director
  
  and trainer at the School of Rhythmical Massage Therapy in Arlesheim.</p>
